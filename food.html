<h1>Kyrgyze Ethnic Dishes</h1>

      <h2>Beshbarmak</h2>
      <p>Beshbarmak is a dish from Central Asian cuisine. It is also known as naryn in Xinjiang, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, as turama or dograma in Karakalpakstan, North Caucasus and Turkmenistan, as kullama in Bashkortostan and Tatarstan. It is a national dish of Kyrgyzstan. The term beshbarmak means "five fingers" because nomads traditionally eat this dish with their hands. Beshbarmak is usually made from finely chopped boiled meat, mixed with dough (typically egg noodles) and chyk, an onion sauce. It is typically served on large communal platters, shared between several people.</p>

      <h2>Plov(Ash)</h2>
      <p>Plov or osh/ash or palov, "pilaf", is a main course native to the southern region of Kyrgyzstan, typically made with rice, pieces of meat, grated carrots and onions. It is usually cooked in a kazan over an open fire; chickpeas, raisins, barberries, or fruit may be added for variation. Although often prepared at home for family and guests by the head of household or the housewife, plov is made on special occasions, sometimes serving up to 1,000 people from a single cauldron on holidays or occasions such as weddings.</p>

      <h2>Typical Kyrgyz food</h2>
      <p>Kyrgyz cuisine is the cuisine of the Kyrgyz, who comprise a majority of the population of Kyrgyzstan. The cuisine is similar in many aspects to that of their neighbors. Traditional Kyrgyz food revolves around mutton, beef and horse meat, as well as various dairy products. The preparation techniques and major ingredients have been strongly influenced by the nation's historically nomadic way of life. Thus, many cooking techniques are conducive to the long-term preservation of food. Mutton and beef are the favorite meats, although in modern times many Kyrgyz are unable to afford them regularly.</p>
